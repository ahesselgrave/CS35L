To start, I used wget to get the coreutils tar file and used tar -xzf to 
extract its contents into my project directory. Once that finished, I 
used cd to go inside the tar output directory. Inside the coreutils dir,
I used mkdir to create an output directory for configure. Then I used
pwd to get my absolute path and put that into "./configure --prefix=\
<absolute path>". When that finished, I used "make -j 8" followed by
"make install" to compile all the files. 

Once that was all done, I used cd to get to the mkdir bin directory and tested
the version 7.6 ls and saw the timestamp display problem. Then I used wget to
download the http file with Brady's patch. I opened it with vim and searched 
for the diff output to see what to change. I removed all the lines prefixed
by a - and added in the 2 + lines and saved the file. I then used cd to go
back to the Makefile directory and used "make" to build the fixed version.

To test, I used touch to change the timestamps of various files in the
respective ls directories and ensured the output did as it should. Regardless
of the timestamp, the installed ls had the wrong output, and the recompiled 
version displayed properly.
