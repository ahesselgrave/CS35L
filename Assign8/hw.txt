I tried to get access to an instance of EC2 by creating an account. Even though
it's supposed to be a free service it got mad at my card information saying it
was unable to confirm because it was unable to do a $1.00 authorization and my
overdraft protection denied that charge, so there goes that. 

Moving on, here are my rankings for the web vulnerabilities. 

1) Heartbleed. Heartbleed allows hackers to send heartbeat SSL packets to a
server and retrieve up to 64kB of server information per heartbeat. With a
simple script a person with malicious intent could retrieve passwords, SSNs,
private keys, and other important encrypted data about the server. 

2) Remote integer overflow. Since this bug could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code as the SSH daemon (typically root), the attacker could easily
take all important information and DDos or corrupt the server.

3) Office memory corruption. Using the converter a hacker can execute arbitrary
code such as spawning a shell on the server and causing mayhem or stealing data.
This is lower than the integer overflow since the priviledges are of the user
and not necessarily root.

4) Struts2 ClassLoader. An attacker can modify the private variables of a class
and steal their contents or load a malicious class that would steal and relay
sensitive information back to the attacker. 

5) ScreenOS SSL DDos. An attacker can do an extended denial of service attack
using malformed SSL packets. This is lower than all the others because although
the server would be down, the server information is still intact and safe from
attackers.
