I used wget to the coreutils tar file and the patch file. I extracted the tar
file and used cd to go into the output directory. I ran ./configure CFLAGS="-g"
and tried to make it, and it would have a recursive error and fail to build. I
applied the patch with the given diff file using patch -p0 <coreutils.diff
and used make to compile it with no issues.

I created a temporary directory in /tmp and touched 3 files with the same
timestamps and commands as Professor Eggert and got the exact same output as
him. 
 
Since the problem is in the sorting, I opened ls.c in emacs and used M-x gdb to
start debugging. I put a breakpoint at sort_files with b sort_files. I ran the
debugger with r -lt /tmp/now /tmp/now1 /tmp/wwi-armistice and saw it stop at
sort_files. I used n to go down and used p sort_type to see it was
compare_mtime. When it got to qsort, I used p compare to see which function the
pointer referred to and saw it was cmp_mtime. I put a breakpoint on that
function and restarted. When it got there I used s to enter it and went to
timespec.h. The implementation used subtraction between the timestamp time and
put it into diff, but this was causing an overflow. I changed it to just use
boolean comparisons instead of subtraction to avoid overflow. I then made a
patch with it using diff -u.

32 bit timestamps in the SEAS NFS, but the SEASNET servers create 64 bit
timestamps, so the upper 32 bits are truncated off the 64 bit time stamp. ls
only gives us the lower 32 bits.
