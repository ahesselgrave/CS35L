I checked out v3.0 again with "git checkout v3.0 -b quote". I applied the patch
with "patch -p1 <quote-3.0-patch.txt" and it patched the 6 .c files it should
have. I opened emacs and used C-x 4 a to open the changelog and entered "hw4
revision". I added the modified .c files with git add src/*.c and commited them
with git commit -m "hw4 revision". I then made the new patch with "git
format-patch -1 --stdout >formatted-patch.txt" and let my partner, Brendan Sio,
test it. He applied the patch with "git am <formatted-patch.txt", used
./configure and make, and said it  built properly with no fuss. ./diff . - and 
./diff --help did what they should have, and make check didn't get upset.

I ran make distdir and checked my ChangeLog file, and lo and behold it had my
"hw4 revision" message in it.
